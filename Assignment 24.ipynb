    "When coding functions, there are several general design guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Functions should have a clear and single purpose. They should perform one specific task and do it well. Avoid creating functions that try to do too much, as this can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Naming**: Choose descriptive and meaningful names for your functions that accurately convey their purpose. Use verbs or verb phrases to indicate actions performed by the function. Make sure the names are consistent and follow a naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function Length**: Keep functions concise and focused. Long functions are often harder to understand and debug. If a function becomes too long, consider refactoring it into smaller, more manageable functions that each serve a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function Documentation**: Provide clear and concise documentation for your functions. Use docstrings to describe the function's purpose, input parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be raised. This helps other developers (and yourself) understand how to use the function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameter Design**: Choose appropriate names for function parameters that convey their purpose and meaning. Consider using default parameter values when appropriate to provide flexibility and make the function more convenient to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoid Global State**: Functions should be designed to operate on their input parameters and local variables. Minimize the use of global variables, as they can introduce unintended side effects and make the function less reusable and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Code Reusability**: Aim for code reuse by creating functions that are modular and can be easily used in different contexts. Avoid duplicating code by factoring out common functionality into separate functions that can be called from multiple places.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and consider possible error scenarios. Use appropriate exception handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions, providing informative error messages or taking appropriate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Testing**: Write test cases for your functions to ensure they work correctly under different scenarios and edge cases. Test your functions thoroughly to catch and fix any issues early in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Efficiency**: Optimize functions for performance when necessary. Consider algorithmic complexity, avoid unnecessary computations or redundant operations, and choose appropriate data structures."

    "Functions can communicate results to a caller in various ways. Here are three common ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Return Statement**: The most common way for a function to communicate its result is through the `return` statement. The function can explicitly specify a value or an expression to be returned. Once the `return` statement is encountered, the function terminates, and the value is passed back to the caller. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modifying Mutable Objects**: Functions can modify mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries) passed as arguments, and the modifications persist outside the function's scope. By modifying the object in place, the function indirectly communicates the result to the caller. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global Variables**: Functions can communicate results by modifying global variables. Although it is generally recommended to minimize the use of global variables, there are scenarios where it may be appropriate. By modifying a global variable, a function can indicate a result or store a value that can be accessed by the caller. For example:\n"
